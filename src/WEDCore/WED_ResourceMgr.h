/*
	WED_ResourceMgr - THEORY OF OPERATION

	This class maintains a lazy-create cache or art asset previews.  It currently supports two art asset classes:
	- OBJ
	- POL

	In the case of OBJ, we use the OBJ_ package for preview and data management, thus an OBJ preview is an XObj8 struct.
	For .pol since there is no package for .pol preview (since it is somewhat trivial) we define a struct.

	HERE'S THE HACK

	Traditionally the UI interface for WED is firewalled off from the document class/implementation using a purely virtual
	abstract interface.  (See ILibrarian.h for example.)  But...I have not had the time to do this here yet.  So
	WED_LibraryMgr is used directly as sort of its own interface.  This is definitely a hack, it's definitely "wrong", but
	it's also definitely not very dangerous at this point in the code's development - that is, WED is not so big that this
	represents a scalability issue.
